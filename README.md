### Sprint Potential Topics
<ol>
<li>Discuss requirements for a GAU-like object for non-NPSP orgs </li>
  <ul> <li>- EDA - scholarships, for profit use cases </li>
 <li> - some orgs would prefer to just Funding Program (idea?) </li>
 <li>  - same objects in multiple packages (e.g. Affiliations in EDA and NPSP)</li> </ul>
<li>How OBM, PMM, NPSP interact/could work together (And maybe maybe how paid apps could play too) </li>
<li>Continue to explore EDA connections (bringing in the Financial Aid conversation from the last sprint)</li>
<li>(maybe) if there is a developer - like Thom Behrens - work on the translation issue that was raised in the HUB</li>
<li>There is an impact group at the sprint - so there may be some overlapping conversations with that team</li>
<li>Reporting, maybe a reporting workbook of sorts</li>
  </ol>
